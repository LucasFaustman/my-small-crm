## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
Tech used: EJS, Node, Express, Javascript, MongoDB

- I was able to gain a deep understanding about how MVC architecture works. 

## Optimizations

1. I would utilize something like Ajax/React in order to automatically update the page when adding, deleting, or editing an item. Currently the page refreshes after those actions are done.

2. I would add an option for search or filtering through items. Currently there is only an option for sorting and pagination.

3. I want to add an invoicing feature where users can keep track of invoices sent, paid, etc.

4. I would like to add a drag and drop feature for moving deals in the pipeline.
 
## Lessons Learned:

- I learned how MVC architecture can be used to create a web application! I had to deepen my knowledge of Express and EJS in order for everything to work.

- I learned how I can use EJS for lots of different Javascript functions! In order to get data such as monthly revenue projected on the dashboard, I had to use the filter array method as well as reduce in order to get to the right number.

- Finally, I learned how vital project planning was. In this project, I had to create a rough mock up using Figma, then begin on the front end inside of EJS, set up my database, then start adding features and APIs. I learned the importance of planning, executing, then optimizing a project.
