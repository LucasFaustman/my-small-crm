## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
Tech used: EJS, Node, Express, Javascript

By working on My Small CRM, I was able to have a deep understanding about how MVC architecture works. 

## Optimizations

1. I would utilize something like Ajax in order to automatically update the page when adding, deleting, or editing an item. Currently the page refreshes after those actions are done.
2. I would add an option for search or filtering through items. Currently there is only an option for sorting and pagination.
 
## Lessons Learned:

I learned how MVC architecture can be used to create a web application! I had to deepen my knowledge of Express and EJS in order for everything to work.

I also learned how I can use EJS for lots of different Javascript functions! In order to get data such as monthly revenue projected on the dashboard, I had to use the filter array method as well as reduce in order to get to the right number.
